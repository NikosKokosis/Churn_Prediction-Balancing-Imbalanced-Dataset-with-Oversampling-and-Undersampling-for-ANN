# Churn Prediction with Imbalanced Dataset

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Churn Prediction with Imbalanced Dataset personal project! In this project, I undertook the challenging task of churn prediction using an imbalanced dataset. Churn prediction is a critical aspect for businesses looking to retain customers and enhance their overall performance. However, dealing with imbalanced data, where the number of churned instances is significantly lower than non-churned ones, presents a substantial challenge. The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust churn prediction model capable of effectively handling imbalanced datasets and delivering accurate results.

## Project Highlights

Here are the key highlights of this project:

- **Churn Prediction**: I implemented a Feedforward neural network churn prediction model using various machine learning techniques.

- **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**: Dealing with imbalanced data is a crucial part of this project, and I explored techniques to address this issue effectively.

## Project Structure

This project comprises the following components:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project code and detailed analysis can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook](Code/ANN.ipynb).

- **Datasets**: The project folder [Dataset](Dataset/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv) contains relevant datasets used for training and evaluation.

## Conclusions

The Churn Prediction with Imbalanced Dataset project demonstrates the importance of addressing imbalanced data challenges in predictive modeling. The developed churn prediction model can assist businesses in identifying potential churn instances and implementing strategies to retain valuable customers.
